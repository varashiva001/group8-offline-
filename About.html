            The Earth is composed of four main layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core, each with unique
            properties and functions. The crust is the thinnest and outermost layer, ranging from about 5 km in oceanic
            areas to 70 km in continental regions. It contains mountains, valleys, soil, and the oceans, and is broken
            into tectonic plates that move slowly, causing earthquakes and volcanic activity. Beneath the crust lies the
            mantle, which is around 2,900 kilometers thick. It is made of semi-solid rock that flows very slowly and is
            responsible for the movement of tectonic plates through convection currents. The next layer is the outer
            core, a liquid layer made mainly of molten iron and nickel. It lies about 2,200 kilometers thick and
            generates the Earth's magnetic field due to its swirling liquid metals. At the very center is the inner
            core, a solid sphere with a radius of about 1,200 kilometers, composed mostly of iron and some nickel.
            Despite the high temperatures, the intense pressure keeps it solid. These layers together make Earth a
            complex, dynamic planet capable of supporting life

                Earth’s climate refers to the long-term weather conditions and patterns experienced in different regions
                across the globe. It includes factors such as temperature, rainfall, wind, humidity, and seasons. The
                Earth is divided into different climate zones such as tropical, dry, temperate, continental, and polar,
                each with its unique characteristics. Several natural factors like latitude, altitude, ocean currents,
                wind patterns, and distance from the sea influence the climate of a region. However, in recent decades,
                human activities such as deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, and industrial emissions have
                significantly altered the climate, leading to global warming and climate change. These changes have
                caused serious environmental issues like rising sea levels, melting glaciers, extreme weather events,
                loss of biodiversity, and threats to food and water security. To combat climate change, it is important
                to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, use renewable energy sources, plant more trees, and adopt
                sustainable lifestyles. Protecting Earth’s climate is essential for the survival of all living beings
                and for maintaining the natural balance of our planet.

                The Earth's atmosphere is composed of a mixture of gases that surround the planet and are vital for
                supporting life. The major component is nitrogen, which makes up about 78% of the atmosphere. Oxygen,
                essential for the respiration of most living organisms, is the second most abundant gas, accounting for
                approximately 21%. Argon, an inert gas, makes up about 0.93%, while carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas
                used by plants during photosynthesis, is present in small amounts around 0.04%. In addition to these
                major gases, there are trace amounts of other gases such as neon, helium, methane, krypton, and
                hydrogen. The atmosphere also contains variable amounts of water vapor, which can range from 0% to 4%
                depending on location and weather conditions. Besides gases, the atmosphere includes dust particles,
                pollen, and other tiny particles that influence weather and air quality. This unique composition of the
                atmosphere helps regulate the Earth’s temperature, protects living beings from harmful solar radiation,
                and enables the water cycle to function effectively.

    <div id="Surface">
        <div>
            <p>The Earth's surface is made up of various natural features known as landforms, which are created by
                natural processes such as erosion, weathering, volcanic activity, and tectonic movements. These
                landforms give shape to the planet and include mountains, valleys, plateaus, plains, deserts, hills,
                islands, and deltas. Mountains are high, steep areas formed by the collision of tectonic plates, while
                valleys are low-lying regions often shaped by rivers. Plateaus are elevated flat regions, and plains are
                broad stretches of flat land ideal for farming. Deserts are dry areas with little rainfall, and islands
                are land masses surrounded by water. Peninsulas are pieces of land surrounded by water on three sides,
                and deltas form at river mouths from sediment deposits. These landforms not only define the physical
                appearance of the Earth but also influence human life by affecting climate, agriculture, settlement
                patterns, and the availability of natural resources.</p>
